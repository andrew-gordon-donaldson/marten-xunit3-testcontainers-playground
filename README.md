# A playground for me to try out some libraries and techs I haven't worked with before.

- Objective 1:  Experiment with the Marten (+ Postgres SQL) tech stack.  Particularly the Event Store capabilities.
- Objective 2:  Try out XUnit v3, because I've been looking for an excuse to try out XUnit... and the Microsoft Test Platform.
- Objective 3:  Try out TestContainers for local dev testing, because I <3 good code coverage and the testing pyramid.  (I'll worry about CI/CD integration later)
